I am Farhan Sheth, a passionate researcher and practitioner in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am currently working on multimodal and truthworthy AI. I am also interested in exploring applications of AI in healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. I graduated from [Manipal University Jaipur](https://jaipur.manipal.edu/) with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZeKCtQQAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at various journals and conferences.
